K-Map Solver
Whipped this up during my test prep. Turns out building a k-map solver is way more interesting than studying for the actual test.
What's This?
A React-based k-map solver that handles 2, 3, and 4 variable logic circuits. Works great most of the time - just gets a bit wonky (sometimes) with lots of 1s in 4-variable maps and the update button sometimes doesnt work (I don't have time to fix this so it'll stay like this).
Why Though?
Sometimes the best way to learn is to build something that solves the problem you're struggling with (I was just bored and decided to code instead of studying).
